<p> <a name="About the course">About the course:</a> </p>
<p>
In professional Computer Aided Design II Course students learn about three major topics:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implementation of Building Information Management that include documentation and analysis of an entire project's lifecycle.</li>
      <li>Data visualization, graphics design and generative design through programing.</li> 
      <li>Students also learn about parametric and computational design of buildings and components through visual programing.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
In order to complete the tasks of the course students need to build an understanding of 
computation through proprietary software such as: 
<ol>
<li> Revit architecture,</li>
<li>Rhinoceroses, etc.</li>
</ol>
and programing with different languages such as: 
<ol>
<li>HTML, </li>
<li>Python, </li>
<li>JAVA, </li>
<li>PHP, </li>
<li>RUBY, etc.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The course is presented to students with different methods that include lectures, 
discussions, lab practices, workshops, assignments and exams. The following table 
shows the detail lectures and exams students take during the course:
